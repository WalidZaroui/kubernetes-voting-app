Voting Application Deployment Guide
This guide outlines the steps to deploy a multi-component voting application on a Minikube Kubernetes cluster. The application stack includes a Voting app, Redis, PostgreSQL, a Worker app, and a Result app. Each component is deployed and exposed as a service where applicable.

Prerequisites
Ensure that the following tools are installed:

Minikube: To create and manage your local Kubernetes cluster.
kubectl: To interact with your Kubernetes cluster.
Docker: For building and managing container images.
Project Overview
The application stack consists of:

Voting App: The front-end application where users can cast votes.
Redis: A caching layer for real-time data storage.
PostgreSQL: A database for storing the vote results.
Worker App: A background processor that transfers data from Redis to PostgreSQL.
Result App: A front-end application for displaying voting results.
Deployment Steps
1. Apply the Voting App Deployment and Service
Deploy the voting app using:

bash
Copier le code
kubectl apply -f voting-app-deploy.yaml
kubectl apply -f voting-app-service.yaml
Verify that the voting service is running by checking its URL:

bash
Copier le code
minikube service voting-service --url
2. Deploy Redis
Deploy Redis as a caching service:

bash
Copier le code
kubectl apply -f redis-deploy.yaml
kubectl apply -f redis-service.yaml
3. Deploy PostgreSQL
Deploy PostgreSQL as the database service:

bash
Copier le code
kubectl apply -f postgres-deploy.yaml
kubectl apply -f postgres-service.yaml
4. Deploy the Worker App
Deploy the worker app, which processes data between Redis and PostgreSQL. Note that this deployment can take a few minutes due to its image size (over 500 MB):

bash
Copier le code
kubectl apply -f worker-app-deploy.yaml
5. Deploy the Result App
Deploy the result app and expose it as a service:

bash
Copier le code
kubectl apply -f result-app-deploy.yaml
kubectl apply -f result-app-service.yaml
Check the result service URL to verify the app is accessible:

bash
Copier le code
minikube service result-service --url
Useful kubectl Commands
Display Pods and Services
To get an overview of running pods and services:

bash
Copier le code
kubectl get pods,svc
Troubleshooting
If any of the pods are not running as expected, use the following commands:

Get Pod Logs:

bash
Copier le code
kubectl logs worker-app-pod
Describe Pod Details:

bash
Copier le code
kubectl describe pod worker-app-pod > troubleshooting_pod_description.txt
kubectl describe pod worker-app-pod
Notes
Ensure that all services are reachable by using the minikube service <service-name> --url command.
The worker-app might take a few minutes to deploy due to the size of its image (over 500 MB). Be patient during this step.
Conclusion
Following these steps should result in a successful deployment of the voting application on your Minikube cluster. Use the troubleshooting section to diagnose any issues that arise during deployment.
